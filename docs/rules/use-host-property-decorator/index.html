ruleName: use-host-property-decorator
type: style
description: Use @HostProperty decorator rather than the `host` property of `@Component` and `@Directive` metadata.
descriptionDetails: 'See more at https://angular.io/styleguide#!#06-03.'
rationale: >-
  The property associated with `@HostBinding` or the method associated with `@HostListener` can be modified only in a single place: in the
  directive's class. If you use the `host` metadata property, you must modify both the property declaration inside the controller, and the
  metadata associated with the directive.
